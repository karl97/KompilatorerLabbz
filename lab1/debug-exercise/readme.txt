Debugging exercise
------------------

The source code for the program "metamatic"
consists of the *.cpp and *.h files in this directory.
Compile them, and run the program.

The program crashes.

1. Use a debugger to find out where the program crashes, and why.
It's a rather large and (intentionally) obscure program,
so it's probably hard to find the problem without a debugger.

2. Fix the problem, and recompile, so the program can execute
without crashing. It's OK to just comment out lines that don't work.

Report where the problem was, why the program crashes,
and what you did to fix the problem.
